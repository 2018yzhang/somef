https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow,To install the current release for CPU-only:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow,pip install tensorflow
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow,Use the GPU package for CUDA-enabled GPU cards:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow,pip install tensorflow-gpu
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow,"See Installing TensorFlow for detailed instructions, and how to build from source."
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow,People who are a little more adventurous can also try our nightly binaries:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow,"Nightly pip packages * We are pleased to announce that TensorFlow now offers nightly pip packages under the tf-nightly and tf-nightly-gpu project on PyPi. Simply run pip install tf-nightly or pip install tf-nightly-gpu in a clean environment to install the nightly TensorFlow build. We support CPU and GPU packages on Linux, Mac, and Windows."

https://github.com/google/sg2im/,Setup
https://github.com/google/sg2im/,All code was developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with Python 3.5 and PyTorch 0.4.
https://github.com/google/sg2im/,You can setup a virtual environment to run the code like this:
https://github.com/google/sg2im/,python3 -m venv env               # Create a virtual environment
https://github.com/google/sg2im/,source env/bin/activate           # Activate virtual environment
https://github.com/google/sg2im/,pip install -r requirements.txt   # Install dependencies
https://github.com/google/sg2im/,echo $PWD > env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/sg2im.pth  # Add current directory to python path
https://github.com/google/sg2im/,# Work for a while ...
https://github.com/google/sg2im/,deactivate  # Exit virtual environment
