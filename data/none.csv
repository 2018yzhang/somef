https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,Note
https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,"At its core, this tool uses xpaths of 'divs' to extract data from them. Since Facebook keeps on updating its site frequently and the 'divs' get changed. Consequently, we have to update the divs accordingly to correctly scrape the data. "
https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,"The developers of this tool have devoted a lot of time and effort in developing and most importantly maintaining this tool for quite a lot time now. In order to keep this amazing tool alive, we need support from you geeks."
https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,"The code is pretty intuitive and easy to understand, so you can update the relevant xpaths in the code when you feel that you have tried many profiles and the data isn't being scraped for any of them (that's a hint that Facebook has updated their site) and generate a pull request. That's quite an easy thing to do. Thanks!"

https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,"With the rise of big data, techniques to analyse and run experiments on large datasets are increasingly necessary."
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,"Parallelization and distributed computing are the best ways to tackle this problem, but the tools commonly available to the bioinformatics community often lack good support for these techniques, or provide a model that fits badly with the specific requirements in the bioinformatics domain and, most of the time, require the knowledge of complex tools or low-level APIs."
