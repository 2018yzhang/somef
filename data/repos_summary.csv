97084,AOPHP is an aspect oriented PHP web app platform.  The system takes an oppinonated software approach where the final object is created &amp; all needed objects are created until the core &amp; final object is created.  This is done through interfaces, inheritance, &amp; eventually traits.  Right now PHP is the only natively supported language though in the future other languages will be supported.  This will happen as I continues to work on my aspect oriented programming layer to C.  My working title for this language, compiler, &amp; tools is "Aspects-We-C".  It works &amp; compiles similarly to how Vala implement object oriented programming in C.  I am still a long way off from having a functional "Aspects-We-C" compiler so for now all I have publicly available is AOPHP.  I am working on a lot of features in AOPHP.  It requires PHP 5.3 &amp; will soon require PHP 6, as soon as traits are implemented.  Far more details on AOPHP can be found by looking at my commit logs than I could possible write here.  Especially going forward.
