{"description": [{"excerpt": "The philosophy behind Backstage is simple: Don't expose your engineers to the full complexity of your infrastructure tooling. Engineers should be shipping code \u2014 not figuring out a whole new toolset every time they want to implement the basics. Backstage allows you add \"stuff\" (tooling, services, features, etc.) by adding a plugin, instead of building a new tool. This saves you work and avoids the need of your team to learn how to use and support yet another tool. \nFor more information go to backstage.io \n", "confidence": [0.8205390744706886, 0.7217214632012141]}, {"excerpt": "We created Backstage about 4 years ago.

Regardless of whether you want to create a new library, view service deployment status in Kubernetes, or check the test coverage for a website -- Backstage will provide all of those tools - and many more - in a single developer portal. \nPhase 3: Ecosystem (later) - Everyone's infrastructure stack is different. By fostering a vibrant community of contributors we hope to provide an ecosystem of Open Source plugins/integrations that allows you to pick the tools that match your stack. \n", "confidence": [0.7469781280521582, 0.7425081027464228]}, {"excerpt": "Our vision for Backstage is for it to become the trusted standard toolbox (read: UX layer) for the open source infrastructure landscape.

Plugins all use a common set of platform API's and reusable UI components.
